Project 1 notes:



Core Items:
1) More than 3 rows populated in each table
2) Four permanant tables:- Student, ActivityGroup, Activity and StudentActivity, and one Temp table:- GenderTemp is used
3) Datatypes used :- int, varchar, date, boolean, char
4) Null Columns :- Student.IsActive, Student.Gender, Activity.IsActive
5) Following Queries handle NULL values in the queries:-
	-- showing NULL value handling through right join  :- this one handles null in join
6) Script is re-runnable

Additional Items:	
1) Created UI mockups using Pencil software. Exported file as HTML. Opening Index.html under MockupsHTML should show all the mockups one after another.
2) ERDiagram.docx has the ER diagram for this db tables. 
3) Foreign key enforcement declared in the creation of table script. Since Cascading deletes are not advisable, I just show that deletion is not possible in a child table when there is a referential integrity. Please uncheck the query under the comment ""-- Showing the power of referential integrity -- The following should throw an error when ran. Following delete statement must be uncommented first""
4) 
5) Publicly available data 2013-demographic-snapshotpublic.csv is first loaded into a staging table in the text format. Then that data is cleansed and loaded into a table with proper datatypes.
6) This database can be extended or leveraged for choosing students for tournaments. Students can be chosen for tournaments based on the number of years they belonged to an activity. Note:- Currently, we don't capture the date when a student enrolled in an activity but it can be added in future if needed.
